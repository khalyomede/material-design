# Contributing

## By creating issues

You can contribute to the project by simply using it. As the project is not perfect, you'll surely find bugs that I didn't see at first place. If you do, please, take some time to fill an issue vie the [GitHub Issues page of the project](https://github.com/aminnairi/material-design/issues).

## By appending changes to the project

An other way to contribute is to append new features to the project. This can be done by forking the project, find some features that are not currently available, developing those features and request a pull via the [GitHub Pull Request page for the project](https://github.com/aminnairi/material-design/pulls). All pull requests may not be merged into the master branch and some of them may be rejected but I'll be sure to discuss about it with you to find a way to include it in the project if it is relevant enough for the project. Pull request that do not reference any issues will not be accepted.

## By fixing issues

You can also contribute by fixing issues that are not referenced in any pull request yet. This may be the best form of contribution for me as it saves me some time to fix bugs and focus more on the core project. See above to find about how to contribute by opening pull requests.
